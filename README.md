# Code Refactor Starter Code

### This is the link to the deployed application [horiseon-web-application]()

The aim of this project was to clean up an existing code by
adding semantic HTML elements where necessary, adding alt attributes
to image elements, make sure all links are working, consolidating
repeated code where necessary at the CSS rules, and other practices
with the aim of maintaining the visual aspect of the code as seen
in a website and going further to fix to 
broken code(a broken link for example).


The following images shows just a fraction of the code where improvements
were made:

- Bad HTML code

- Good HTML code

The aim again was to maintain how the code looks when it 
is rendered in a browser with a more better and readable code as shown below:
